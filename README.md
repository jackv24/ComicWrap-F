# ComicWrap F

A rebuild of [ComicWrap](https://github.com/jackv24/ComicWrap) in Flutter. **WIP!**

This is super not ready for active use, you've been warned!

# Building and Running

There are a few parts to the whole system:
- A Flutter App (for Android or iOS)
- Firebase project for the Database, Functions and Auth
- A Node.js service for scraping comic websites (which runs on Google App Engine)

## Prerequisites

- Flutter App
  - [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
  - [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) (or [VS Code with dev tools](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/vs-code))
  - (for iOS dev) macOS with XCode
- [Firebase Emulators](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite)
- Node.js & npm

## Setup

The Flutter app should work on it's own and will connect to my Firebase instance. As long as you're not working on backend stuff you'll only need the Flutter tools.
